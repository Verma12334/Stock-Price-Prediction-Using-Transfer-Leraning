# **Stock Price Prediction using Transfer Learning**

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging Transfer Learning. The dataset consists of historical stock prices, and the model is built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networksâ€”a type of recurrent neural network that is well-suited for time series forecasting.


# Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for experimentation and model building.
models/: Saved models after training, to avoid re-training the model each time.
src/: Contains the main scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: Project description and instructions.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.

# Requirements
The project uses the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
tensorflow
sklearn
yfinance
To install all dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset consists of historical stock price data for various companies, including the following columns:

Date
Open Price
High Price
Low Price
Close Price
Adjusted Close Price
Volume
The dataset is fetched using the yfinance library, which pulls stock market data directly from Yahoo Finance.


# Model Architecture
The model utilizes Transfer Learning by leveraging a pre-trained LSTM architecture. LSTMs are particularly effective for sequential data like stock prices.

# Model Summary:
Input Layer: Sequential time steps (60 days look-back).
Hidden Layers:
LSTM layers with 100 units.
Dropout layers for regularization.
Output Layer: Dense layer with 1 output unit for stock price prediction.


# Training and Evaluation
The model is trained on 80% of the dataset, and the remaining 20% is used for validation. The performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and plotted to compare actual vs. predicted stock prices.

Usage
Download Dataset: Use the yfinance library to fetch stock data.
Train Model: Run the notebook notebooks/Stock_Prediction_Transfer_Learning.ipynb to preprocess the data, train the model, and visualize the results.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict future stock prices.
Results
The model successfully predicts the general trend of the stock prices, although accuracy may vary depending on the stock and the chosen parameters. The plot below shows the actual and predicted prices for Reliance Industries Limited.


# **Improvements**

# **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
Experiment with different parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs.
Feature Engineering: Add additional features like technical indicators to improve prediction accuracy.
Model Architecture: Try more advanced architectures such as transformers or attention-based models for better results.


# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Transfer Learning in time series forecasting, particularly for stock price prediction. While it offers promising results, there is still room for improvement by fine-tuning the model and adding more features.
